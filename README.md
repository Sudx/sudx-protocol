## What is SUDX?

SUDX is a project designed to create a transparent and decentralized funding ecosystem for the open-source software that powers our world. We aim to bridge the gap between the open-source ethos and the financial power of Web3.

## The Problem

Open-source software moves the world. It is the foundation of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the greatest technological innovations. However, its creators—the developers, maintainers, and designers—often depend on unstable donations, volunteer work, and fragmented funding. The community's gratitude exists, but it rarely translates into fair and sustainable financial support.

## The Solution

Inspired by the `sudo` command in Linux, SUDX aims to become the native token of the open-source ecosystem, providing concrete tools:
1.  **Direct & Transparent Donations:** Support your favorite projects with fast, auditable transactions on the Solana blockchain.
2.  **Decentralized Governance (DAO):** The SUDX community will decide the future, collectively funding new tools, bug bounties, and initiatives.
3.  **On-Chain Reputation:** Developers can earn rewards for their contributions, building a valued and immutable on-chain resume.
4.  **Native Integration:** Our long-term vision is to integrate SUDX directly into the tools developers already use, like Git and CI/CD platforms.
